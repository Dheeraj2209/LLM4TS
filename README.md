# LLM4TS: A TypeScript Framework for Large Language Model Integration

LLM4TS is a modular TypeScript library that simplifies working with Large Language Models (LLMs). It offers a unified, extensible interface to send chat or text prompts, handle responses, stream tokens, cache results, and switch providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Local models). Designed to work in both Node.js and browser environments.

## Features

- **Unified Interfaces**: Seamless abstraction for `Chat`, `Text`, and `Embedding` interactions.
- **Streaming Support**: Stream tokens in real-time for responsive UIs.
- **Prompt Templates**: Modular templates for dynamic prompt generation.
- **Caching & Memoization**: Automatically caches responses for repeated prompts.
- **Batch Processing**: Evaluate multiple prompts efficiently.
- **Fully Typed**: TypeScript-first design for safe, predictable development.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Switch between OpenAI, Claude, or any custom backend easily.

LLM4TS aims to bring clarity, control, and extensibility to the development of applications that rely on large language models. Whether you're building intelligent chat systems, semantic search, or prompt-driven tools, LLM4TS provides a structured TypeScript-first foundation to interact with multiple LLM providers while abstracting the complexities of prompt construction, streaming, and caching.
